          In collaboration, WPP is set to transform Sydney's iconic Powerhouse Museum into the vibrant WPP House during SXSW Sydney. This central hub serves as a dynamic space for exploring groundbreaking ideas and addressing current and future industry challenges. Throughout the week-long event (15-22 October), WPP House welcomes agencies and partners, fostering creative transformation and offering five days of stimulating discussions, emerging concepts, and open dialogue.

          In my role as a designer and creative technologist at Design Bridge and Partners, our team was responsible for the branding and the developing of interactive tools for WPP House.

          The primary deliverable for this project is crafting a generative key visual that represents what WPP House will offer. This final key visual features a 3D vortex of colorful balls symbolizing the innovation and creativity WPP brings. It aims to reshape WPP's image as forward-thinking, approachable, and captivating. This dynamic visual can be integrated into websites as interactive elements. Additionally, it can be exported as still images and GIFs for use in various social content formats during the event.

As an integral aspect of the branding strategy, the team opted to develop a variety of interactive tools catering to both participants and in-house content creators. The overarching objective is to craft enjoyable and user-friendly tools that not only entertain but also spotlight the creative innovation inherent in WPP. The following are the primary tools offered to participants during WPP House, and both of these tools operate as web-based interactions.
          <br><br>
          <b>PORTRAIT TOOL</b>
          <br/>
The Portrait Tool serves a dual purpose of engaging participants and personalizing their experience with WPP House. Users could upload their photos or graphics, and the tool would transforms these images into dynamic, exploding portraits in a 3D space. The visual impact is not only entertaining but also aligns participants with the dynamic and innovative essence of WPP House. This personalized touch fosters a connection, making participants active contributors to the event's visual narrative.
<br><br>

This tool offers dual functionality. Firstly, users can upload a photograph or portrait, and the tool will generate dots based on the colors present in the original image. Alternatively, users can upload greyscale graphics, and the tool will automatically generate dots that align with the brand colors of WPP House.

          <b>IMAGE CROPPING TOOL</b>
          <br/>
Designed with in-house content creation in mind, the Image Cropping Tool streamlines the process to create visual content for each speaker. By allowing them to upload their images and generating a cropped, dotted version, this tool ensures that all visuals associated with speakers harmonize with WPP House's overarching branding for non-designers. This not only maintains visual consistency but also reinforces the distinctive and cohesive identity of WPP House across various speaker-related materials.

          The dedicated website for the event acts as a digital focal point. Beyond offering essential information about speakers, it serves as an immersive platform. Detailed profiles of speakers generate anticipation and interest. Additionally, the website hosts a showcase of the interactive visuals. This strategic blend of information and interaction encourages exploration, engagement, and sharing. The website becomes an extension of the event, capturing the essence of WPP House and making it accessible to a broader audience, transcending physical boundaries.

This holistic approach, encompassing interactive tools and a dynamic website, ensures a multifaceted and engaging experience for participants and online audiences alike, reinforcing WPP House's brand image as innovative, approachable, and captivating.
